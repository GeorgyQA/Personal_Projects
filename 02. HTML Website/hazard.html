<b> <font size=+1> <center> Hazard </center> </font> </b>
<p> <b> Hazard </b> is the arbitrary force that points to the sheer randomness of each moment. </p>
<p>
We know nothing regarding where everything is heading, and at times we are blind by the idea of control over our lives. All it takes is an <i> illness, financial collapse </i> or even the <i> death of someone dear </i> to wake us up from this illusion and to realize how little is in our influence and how much <b> everything is in the hands of the Universe. </b> </p>

<p> Even though at first, it might seem that we deal with aspects of life in an isolated form, in reality everything that we encounter, is linked together and coordinated by an invisible energy, a master conductor if you will, that some refer to as fate or destiny, but here we will call it Hazard. </p>

<p> "'Everything is happening with a reasonand beyond your reason, both at the same time'

Romanian author Cosmin Onofrei appears to be making his publishing debut with this impressive volume of his thoughts, becoming a treasured counselor and guide for opening windows onto reality that encourage us to fully experience life's possibilities.
Everyone who reads this illuminating book will find personal aspects to absorb and incorporate - that is the nature of Cosmin's communication.
Hopefully we will see more of his writing. Recommended." - GradyHarp- Author - The Art of Man </p>

"This is a short but powerful writing with a series of deep introspections in each chapter.
The author touches upon the many nuances of one's spiritual journey, and how we hold ourselves back from fully experiencing life.
I really loved how relatable this book was - there were many examples from daily life that beautifully wrapped around the concepts.
Would recommend a read if you're looking for some valuable spiritual insights and reminders." - Vasundhra Gupta -MySpiritualShenanigans.Blog </p>

"This non-fiction book is written for a general audience. The daily messages are so helpful that you can't stop thinking about them. It is written in a very insightful and respectful way and it is superbly researched and addictive.
I found this book really helpful and inspiring for any person that wants to improve their life.
I can't wait to look more into what the author has to offer, I would thoroughly recommend it." - EvelynVignuda - Teacher </p>

"I've read a good assortment of these self help books and they always seem to be the same. I honestly didn't expect much from this one, however, I was intrigued by the description, so I just started browsing through it. Ended up reading it all in one take. I was delightfully surprised... no other self help book I've read has put things into perspective so clearly and concisely, truly. " - Dan'Doc Colour' Ackerman - Author- A Zany Zops A To Z Rhyming Boook </p>

"The book talks about acceptance of both good and bad. The author picks a lot of points related to fear, growth, happiness and destiny. The book is short but is well-written.
I love the cover. I feel it represents how we humans hold so many feelings and emotions onto a thread.
The author's knowledge and research is very visible. The title relates well with the content.
The book is heavy on information and will be liked more if taken a little at a time."- Urvashi Jain - Blog - Bookamour2017.wordpress.com </p>
