<p> <b> <font size=+2> Iași </font> </b> is the seat of the county of the same name, Moldova, Romania. Iasi was the capital of Moldova in the period 1564-1859, one of the two capitals of the United Principalities between 1859 and 1862 and the capital of the Kingdom of Romania between 1916 and 1918 (during the First World War, when Bucharest was under German occupation). At the 2011 census, the municipality of Iasi had a population of 290,422 and was the fourth largest city in Romania. The population of Iași has a constant growth from year to year due to economic and financial opportunities. According to Eurostat, with a population of 507,100 inhabitants (in 2019), the Iași metropolitan area is the second largest in Romania (after Bucharest).

<p> The city of Iași is located in the eastern part of Moldova, in the Moldavian Plain, being placed in the path of the old trade routes that connected the north and west of Europe with the continental southeast and the Near East. The city is on the Bahlui River, a tributary of the Jijia, which flows into the Prut River. In the medieval period, Târgul Ieșilor was located on one of the most important commercial roads in the area, namely on the axis Lvov (Poland) - Constantinople, the most important city of that period. Being on this axis helped its development, as all the traders to and from Constantinople passed through here.</p>
<dl>
<dt> <i> Geographical location </i> </dt>
<dd> Through its expansion, Iasi is the legendary "city of the 7 hills", compared in 1691 by the Italian Marco Bandini as "A new Rome". The seven hills are Cetătuia, Galata, Copou, Bucium-Păun, Șorogari, Repedea and Breazu, with altitudes varying between 50 m in Lunca Bahluiului and 400 m on Dealul Păun and Dealul Repedea. The main hills are Copou, Cetătuia, Tătărași and Galata. The city is also crossed by the Nicolina river, the Bahlui river and the Șorogari stream (called Cacaina in the Middle Ages, because garbage was thrown here); to the east of the city, the Ciric stream flows, on which three lakes are artificially created for recreational purposes. </dd>
<dt> <i> Topography </i> </dt>
<dd> Located north of Codrii Iașilor, the old town is in a quadrangle bounded by the current streets Ștefan cel Mare (Ulița Mare), Alexandru Lăpușneanu, Independţei (Podul Hagioaiei), Elena Doamna and Grigore Ghica (Ulița Ruseasca), the core of the city being in the area of ​​the Palace of Culture (former Palat Domnesc) and Costache Negri (Ulița Veche). The new city expanded in all directions, including in the first phase (18th-19th centuries) the neighborhoods of Copou, Sărărie, Țicău, Tătărași, Ciurchi, and partially Nicolina and Păcurari. In the second phase (20th century), the neighborhoods of Păcurari (the new, western part), Nicolina (the new, southern part, today called C.U.G.), Frumoasa-Poitiers, Socola, Bucium, Canta, Galata, Mircea cel Bătrân were included , Alexandru cel Bun, Dacia and Grădinari, with the addition of the Industrial Zone. The city has as suburbs several localities which, from an administrative point of view, are still considered rural settlements, but, from an urban planning point of view, they are presented as urban settlements: Dancu, Tomești, Ciurea and Lunca Cetătuii. The urban trend is to expand Iasi, these localities being included in the metropolitan area, along with other localities: Păun, Bârnova, Horpaz, Miroslava (with Valea Adâncă and Balciu), Valea Lupului and Breazu. Following the explosion of the construction phenomenon of the last decade, some of these localities are today practically united with the city. </dd>
<dt> <i> 
Climate </i> </dt>
<dd> The climate has a pronounced continental character, being influenced by air masses of eastern origin. Summer is dominated by dry weather with high temperatures, and in winter the effect of air masses coming from the north and northeast is felt to the full, the region being frequently haunted by blizzards. Droughts, late spring and early autumn frosts, rain showers accompanied by hail, complete the features of the specific continental climate regime. </dd>
