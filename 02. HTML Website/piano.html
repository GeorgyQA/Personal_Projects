<font size=+2> What is piano in music definition? </font> <br> <br> A piano is a musical instrument that is played using a keyboard. It produces sound by striking strings with hammers that are controlled by the keys on the keyboard. The piano is a member of the percussion family of instruments, as it produces sound through a mechanical action.
<br> <br>
The piano has been an essential instrument in music history since its invention. It has been used in countless genres, from classical to pop and rock. The piano has also been the instrument of choice for many famous composers, such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin. Its unique sound has inspired countless musicians and audiences alike, making it a beloved instrument worldwide.
<br> <br>
The piano was not the first keyboard instrument to be invented. The earliest keyboard instruments were the hydraulis, the organ, and the harpsichord. These instruments used a mechanism that plucked the strings to create sound, rather than striking them with a hammer. However, in the 1700s, a new type of keyboard instrument emerged: the pianoforte, which would eventually become the piano we know today.
